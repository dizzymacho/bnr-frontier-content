Scott Burton and Israel Machovec discussed making a React Native mobile app for The Frontier. While creating a mobile app for The Frontier isn't solving a high priority problem, creating content for React Native is something we're interested in exploring.

#### The Idea

The idea is to create a React Native MVP of The Frontier. We'll be using the responsive mobile designs created by the design team (We have these in Zeplin).  

#### Why?
With an MVP of The Frontier as our base application, we'll create a content series around the process of creating the MVP (5-10 screencasts).

Some quick examples:

* Interacting with APIs using React Native?
* Different ways to create React Native components?
* Getting your App ready for the App Store?  


#### Future Content
Additionally, we'll then be able to use this app as a base project for any React Native tutorials in the future. This will make is easier for our users following along to build upon the project.

#### Next Steps
* Scott talks to Josh about the idea/project
* Israel gets the mobile designs
* Israel and Scott meet next week to roadmap project
* Find others interested in the project
