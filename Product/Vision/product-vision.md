## Product
There are too many blockers for us to continue using current platform. Before the end of the year we will migrate to a third-party CMS. WordPress would allow the product to stay consistent with BNR's brand and styling. This would also give us a single login for our users across platforms using Gravatar.

## Content
We need to stay consistent with the idea of "micro-learning" - learning in short, meaningful burst that can be carried out more regularly. The types of content that fall into this category include:

* Screencasts
* Courses
* Learning Paths
* Digital Guides
* Quizzes
* Challenges

### Screencasts
Think or screencasts as power-ups to grant new skills to the users who watch them. Screencasts can be standalone or part of a Course Category.

### Courses
Courses include 5-10 screencasts, digital guides, quizzes, and assignments that build on a topic using a single app.  

### Learning Paths
Learning paths include are a sequential series of Courses. These are used for topics that increase in complexity. These can also be topics that let an experienced developer hit the ground running with a new tool, skill, platform.

### Blog Posts
These are short posts that build on concepts within a course.  

### Digital Guides
A digital guide is an excerpt from our books in the format of online documentation/tutorials.  

### Quizzes  
Quizzes will be added to courses to measure knowledge retention and award credits.

### Challenges
We'll create a list of challenges that we can advertise either monthly/ weekly.

## Gamification
We will boost engagement levels with gamification. We will reward learners who work through our content with credits and certifications. Credits can be used within the BNR store.

## Store
The store contains products for users to purchase with gamification credits or card. Merchandise can only be purchased via credits. Products would include:

* BNR Merchandise
* Courses
* Learning Paths
* Digital Guides
* Subscriptions

## Community
The goal of a "community" would be to migrate the existing book forum into a WordPress forum. This stays inline with a single sign on for users.

## Reporting/Analytics
All user analytics can be tracked and stored within HubSpot.

## Marketing
Marketing efforts will be contained within HubSpot. This includes analytics, reporting, and emails.  

The emails we will need include:
* Transactional
* Welcome
* Promotional
* Winback
* Newsletter

Dashboards we will need include:
* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
* item 4
* item 5
