## An Introduction to The Frontier

![](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/2O0K0Y1e3z2V1i0n0o1w/Image%202018-11-14%20at%208.09.58%20AM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=2812380&v=5b78cb3c)

### What is The Frontier?

[The Frontier](https://thefrontier.bignerdranch.com) is a screencast subscription product, intended to teach practical skills to professional developers, offering intermediate to advanced content.

The intent of the product is to address market problems, such as:

* <strong>Learn New Skills Quickly.</strong> It's more than learning a new skill, your time is valuable. Our screencast are designed to help you gain the mastery of learning a new skill and structuring code.
* <strong>Focused training.</strong> Follow a proven process to write better code. Our content extends the material delivered in our books and courses, including tips and tricks that only the experts know.
* <strong>Navigate the noise.</strong> Let us be your mentor and guide your steps. Know what to learn next, why it‚Äôs applicable, and how it will make your life easier as a developer. Let us be your mentor and guide steps. Know what to learn next, why it‚Äôs applicable, and how it will make your life easier as a developer.  

All of this aligns with the Big Nerd Ranch brand: <i>to be authentically useful to developers looking to expand a skillset, solve a problem, or progress a career.</i>

### Who is our Audience?

A proven way to learn new skills is to learn from an expert who has been there before. For some of the more advanced developers in the room, <strong>if you had to train an internal BNR employee on a new topic, what would you create?</strong>

If you could go back in time and give yourself a screencast on a topic, what would that be? (No, a screencast about Bitcoin doesn't count üòÇ)

### How You Can Help

There are 3 ways you can help on The Frontier:

* Creating a Screencast, Series, or Skill Pack
* Reviewing your teams oultines / scripts
* Creating new ideas / topics and adding them to our pipeline
* Writing Screencast Descriptions
* Work on the platform - [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2011023)

We are currently looking for Screencast Wranglers for iOS and Android. Wranglers meet every other week to help create our content pipeline and discuss new ideas for The Frontier.

### What You Need

There's a few things you'll need in order to get started.

* You should have access to [The Frontier Screencasts Google Team Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AB5mvO1W-JOUUk9PVA)
* A Mac with QuickTime (it is included)
* USB Microphone (Preferred)
* Uninterrupted quiet time (turn off slack and notifications)


### Booking Time in Replicon

You can book time in Replicon to work on The Frontier.

<strong>Big Nerd Ranch - Internal >> The Frontier - Content</strong>

In a weeks time, you should deliver 4 screencasts.  
* 40 hours = 4 screencasts

If you do not have a full week, you can schedule by hours.
* 10 hours = 1 screencast

<i>Note: this can adjusted based on time, material, etc. just talk to The Frontier PM</i>

## Defining the Screencast


### What is a Screencast? ü§î

A screencast is a digital recording of computer screen output, also known as a video screen capture, often containing audio narration. The term screencast compares with the related term screenshot; whereas screenshot generates a single picture of a computer screen, a screencast is essentially a movie of the changes over time that a user sees on a computer screen, enhanced with audio narration.  

Thanks, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast).  

Think of screencasts as power-ups to grant new skills to the developers who watch them.

#### How long should a screencast be?
* Our screencasts must be 5-8 minutes long and should be immediately applicable to a developer's work.
* They should be intermediate-to-advanced and complement our curriculum -- they are not substitutes.

#### What is NOT a Screencast?
* It's NOT a Video Tour
  * This is NOT a video tour that shows off already written code, talking about a concept. We want to explain the concept to the user while solving a problem.
* There are NO Talking Heads
  * This is NOT a video of talking heads, no-one is speaking to you directly, looking at the camera (no head shots or videos of a person).

### Types of Screencasts
We have 3 different types of screencasts for The Frontier:  

* Standalone: Discrete, digestible videos that can exist on their own.
* Series: 3-5 screencasts that build upon each other in some way.
* Skill Pack: 5-10 screencasts that let an experienced developer hit the ground running with a new tool, skill, platform, etc.

A series should help a user create or build something useful, a skill pack should prepare the user to apply their knowledge in their own work.  

#### Standalone Example:  
Our screencast on [Xcode Inline Documentation](https://thefrontier.bignerdranch.com/screencasts/Xcode-Inline-Documentation) teaches the user how to document their Swift code using Xcode's Markup support, and Jazzy.

#### Series Example:  
Our [Easy Backend API with Rails Series](https://thefrontier.bignerdranch.com/skill-packs/easy-backend-api-with-rails) contains 7 videos that help the user create a web service using Rails and Heroku.

We also have an [Android NFC Reading/Writing Series](https://thefrontier.bignerdranch.com/skill-packs/android-nfc-reading-writing) with 5 videos that help you build out an Android app capable of reading and writing NFC tags.

<i>note: until we create a new category for series we have to label them as skill packs</i>

#### Skill Pack Example:
The [Getting to Know tvOS Skill Pack](https://thefrontier.bignerdranch.com/skill-packs/getting-started-with-tvos) prepares iOS developers to apply their established skills to this new Apple platform.  

### Ask a Question
This is a quick exercise that will get your mind right before diving into a topic/idea.  

#### Choose an idea/topic and ask yourself the following question:  

<i>What will the user be able to learn by following along with the author in this video?</i>

#### The answer to the question should be:  

<i>The user will be able to _______ in their projects after watching the author explain as they work.</i>

#### Example:
For example, the answer for a video about stack views in iOS could be:  

The user will be able to simplify their AutoLayout with StackViews by watching the author convert a view with only AutoLayout to using StackViews.  

<i>Note: This is not an overview of stack views, we don‚Äôt go over the API, we don‚Äôt just show off all the flags and features of an API (‚Äúyou can make it spin up, down, left, right, etc.‚Äù Don‚Äôt do this!), we are showing how to convert it from a default (that we teach in our course), and why that‚Äôs useful and practical.</i>

## The Screencast Process

Stick to what you know -- we can't stress this enough. Screencasts are not for us, the authors, to learn something or research something new.  

>"It's pretty easy to get into the mindset of tackling something new and huge because we're Awesome." - a wise bork once said  

We have plenty of outlets for that in our nerdcamps, self-directed learning, conferences, etc. Your first mistake would be to tackle something you don‚Äôt know, and haven‚Äôt already done in a client project, or shown in after-hours lab.  

We have a ton of ideas that have come directly from the post class labs, from our customers themselves(!) asking via support on The Frontier platform itself, and our audience is looking for you to show things you already know.  

It is critical we do not use this time for self-learning as it will show. And it‚Äôs not the point of the screencasts.  

### Choosing a Topic / Idea

We have a pipeline of topics gathers into Google Sheets. This is a list of approved topics that should help get started. If you have any new ideas, add them to the sheet.  

* [iOS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FzO0_NztoZQgQ76W_VDo1ZEM_pdbDJIXrd_xQF7BwOU/edit#gid=0)
* [Android](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ytR9EYGJvIda3sB9r8Ih25dT98Hee9ci90onhanA7bY/edit#gid=0)
* [Web](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s4nSbeXSzAw3423fVHOTBvW4_BwLBretWMX7R2yj6S0/edit#gid=680817060)
* [Design](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_8vKoox5cf8eX4HuwMl2wmtM-ImV_tP6_Q_N9xyeCgg/edit#gid=0)

<i>Note: They've gotten a little messy and if you have any questions just contact @imac (Israel Machovec) on Slack.</i>

#### Some questions to ask before getting started...
Before choosing a topic, get your mind right by asking yourself a few questions.   

* What builds on a chapter in our book or lesson in our training?
* What blog article have we written that builds on a topic?
* Welcome diversions. The most rewarding adventures often start with an unexpected detour. Perhaps that distraction will guide you onward.
* What have I had to do on a client project recently that helped?
* What am I opinionated about and know?
* What did I just see come across our platform slack channel or I looked up on Stack Overflow that bit me recently?

#### Examples

Bad Idea: <strike>Threading</strike>  
Good Idea: Using Dispatch Groups to perform threading in iOS for fetching URLs  

Bad Idea: <strike>Designing an app icon</strike>  
Good Idea: Taking an existing icon and converting it to responsive for Android Oreo  

Bad Idea: <strike>How to build an API for an iPhone/Android app</strike>  
Good Idea: How to version an API already deployed in the App/Play Store  

Know thyself. If you tend to tackle big things, get some help to make your topic short, concise, and relevant to working developers.  

While brainstorming, you‚Äôll probably come up with a few ideas that you discard for one reason or another. Add those ideas to the ideas list. Someone else might be able to make use of them, or they might inspire another Nerd in an unexpected way.  


### How to Create an Outline / Script

#### Create a folder in [The Frontier Team Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AB5mvO1W-JOUUk9PVA)
Name the folder the title of your screencast. We'll show you how to structure your project folder later.  

#### Create a Google Doc for your Outline / Script

Create a Google Doc with the title of your screencast:  

<i>Example: Minimizing Bundle Sizes in React [Script]</i>  

Create your outline at the top of the document. This is a high-level look of what you will cover in the screencast.   

Write out some sample code, what parts you will replace, and the general flow. Think outline, then flesh it out a bit.  

Examples:

[Navigation Testing Outline / Script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dAT3Aj0ovq2f7LxSil9s8udjxluBenMfTbw-9No6mEI/edit)

[Breakpoints & Exception Handlers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z95Sk0r2-J1xt-vaW842_Anup4bwKYEVsLF8QqDgKQY/edit)

[Load Screens in React](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZwtpfhY5UGofphCh2vrtpcwj1jbgE649PNotSgmlwg/edit#heading=h.qb2hx088vymi)

[Using Java 8 Lambda on Android](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cwZtN8Rb54P70zp977dj63anmaT0UkGck79XHsD617M/edit)

Here are some questions to help you get started with your script:  

* What should the viewer be able to do as a result of watching the video?
* Is this something I can accomplish in a 5-8 minute video?
* What parts will we code/type together, and what should already exist?

#### Pro Tip

Consider your script to be the written form of what you'll show, so be sure to include things like:

```
<show the emulator and click on it a few times to show what we're doing>

Let's get started

<open up Xcode and show the flangy-file and resource>
```
See the tips section for more tips and suggestions on the outlining and script process.

### Feedback / Review

Once you've finished your first draft, you can send reviewers a link to your Google Doc. You can use the #the-frontier-content channel or your team channel (ie. #android).  

If you're in a series, or doing a skill pack, definitely consider how to build on the past concept.  

If you're screencasting as part of a dedicated Frontier week, you will have daily check-ins with your Product Manager (Israel Machovec). These will ensure you're getting the feedback you need to keep chugging along.  

Incorporate any feedback in your script and outline. Consider adding more ideas for future screencast if you overshot or made it too long/complex or covered too many ideas.  

Don't get too far until you ask for feedback. Iterate. Ask for feedback, and repeat to do another screencast.  

### Creating Your Sample Project

If we could show off existing client projects (we can't), this would be easy.

Carve off just enough of a project to show the main concept. Consider also creating a new app and starting fresh as you build it together to illustrate a concept, but careful here.  It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect.  It just needs to get your main concept across.

Check this into GitHub or version control it properly in this [screencast project repo](https://github.com/bignerdranch/screencasts)

#### Pro Tips

Build on current screencast projects?  
* Talk to some of your team members. You may be able to build off another screencast project.

Sample apps from our Books / Courses
* We have a few apps from our books and courses. We can leverage these apps and build upon new ideas and concepts. Our students will be able to continue their training after the class using the projects they've already created.

### How to Record Your Screen

Since we are using a third-party editor, you can simply use quicktime to record your screen and audio. If you don't plan on doing your own editing to the video files, the QuickTime .mov files will work for the editing team.

#### Screencast Guidelines
Here are a few guidelines for setting up your IDE and Desktop.  

<strong>IDE Setup</strong>

* Font size: Minimum 18pt (iOS/Mac can use the Presentation theme in Xcode)
* High contrast theme. For example, Xcode has a Presentation theme which is colored text against a white background. Dark themes usually present issues when rendering video.

<strong>Desktop Setup:</strong>

* Hide your dock
* Remove as many status bar icons as you can. Use a tool like Bartender if necessary
* Hide the Date/Time clock from the status bar which hinders in continuity when you are editing.
* Turn off notifications

DO NOT write code towards the bottom 2 inches of the screen. Usually it is covered with video controls and it is hard to see what is going on. This can be a problem If you plan on using the terminal within your text editor. To avoid doing this you can put tape on your screen which signals you have reached the danger zone.

#### Using QuickTime
Record your screen only (no audio, or can be removed). When choosing your setting, please use - <strong>1920x1080 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio</strong>

Don't worry about mistakes, or timing at this point. Just record yourself doing the tutorial. It may help to read parts of your script, the important parts you want to show, but don't worry about the intro ("Hi my name is") or the outro, lessons learned, any of that. You are just recording the screen.

This will generate a .mov movie file. And it may be longer or shorter than you need.

Check out the tips section for more best practices and suggestions on recording your screen.

<i>We used to encourage the use of ScreenFlow to record and edit screencasts. Now that we have editors, you do not need ScreenFlow. However, if you'd like it, you can download a trial version that watermarks videos. This is Good Enough‚Ñ¢ for rough-cut screencasts. When you're ready to produce a final screencast, you can purchase the $129 license with your Big Nerd Ranch company credit card.</i>

### How to Record Your Audio

Once you're done recording your video, it's time to record just the audio.

Open up QuickTime. Click New Audio Recording.

Make sure the levels are good. In terms of QuickTime's level meter, shoot for:

* 70% mean
* 60% on the quiet side
* 90-95% on the loud.
* Never hit 100%!

![](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/070R1O2U3Y1h2K103c1C/Nrf9Su5nu_u9iAwH.gif?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=2812380&v=8bed7379)

It'll clip/distort and sound horrible. (If you've got a meter with numbers, aim to peak between -12dB and -6dB.)

#### Record Your Audio

Play your video ‚Äì be sure to mute any audio from the video! ‚Äì and record audio only.

This will produce an .m4a audio file.

We'll show you some Pro Tips for recording your audio below.

#### Intros & Outros  
Each screencast should begin with an intro. You'll record these separately, AFTER you finish your screen recording.

Each screencast should begin with an intro:

* My name is <i>"your name"</i> and I'm a <i>"your title"</i> at Big Nerd Ranch.
* In this screencast, I will be showing you how to ____.
* After this screencast, you will be able to ____.

Each screencast should end with an outro:

* In this screencast, we showed/built/converted <i>"insert what you did"</i> so that you can <i>"insert what they will be able to do"</i>
* Once again, my name is ____.
* Thanks for watching, and we'll see you here next time soon.

You can vary these intros/outros slightly, of course, but the goal is a quick intro and right into practical, useful material.

#### Pro Tips
<strong>Record your intros and outros after you make your screencast.</strong>  
We can add them in after you've finished the meat of the screencast

<strong>You may have to pause your video in some places, because you have too much to say about the code that's being typed or the process you are showing.</strong>  
That's fine, our editors can slow down the video for you.

<strong>You may have to wait and not say anything in some places, because you are typing or completing something. Embrace the silence, for now.</strong>  
That's fine, our editors will remove the silence.

<strong>Record 20 seconds or so of "room tone" at the beginning of each video.</strong>  
Room tone is just the sound of the room without any noise going on; this is used by our editors to patch over unwanted noises in the vocals or background when they hear them. Easiest is to just announce the name of the video and then say "holding for room tone," then sit quietly for 20 seconds before starting the video.

<strong>If you pause or re-record phrases, simply take notes for the editors</strong>  
They are professionals and can generally figure it out, but if you want things to line up a certain way, let them know. We'll show you how to do this in Editing/Post.  

## Editing / Post

### Creating a Description
A description gives product and marketing the tools they need to promote your screencast to clients and users. We've outlined a few questions with examples in a template to help you get started.   

#### Create a New Google Doc
Create a Google Doc in your project folder and create a file with your screencast title and [Description]  

(ie. Rails Api Part 2 - Deployment [Description])

Copy and paste the template: [The Frontier: Screencast Description Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-jxmEiw10li-yENgGPkvDTmEKoNvW394TJPCspK6lus/edit)

Your description will include:

* Category
  * iOS
  * Android
  * Web
  * Design
  * tvOS
* Question/Business Problem
  * This question should help solves a specific business problem.
  * Example
    * How can I improve the performance of my React app in production?
* Business Problem Relevance...
  * The description should explain why this is critical for the specified business problem.
  * Example
    * When building modern web applications, app performance is critically important. As developers, we strive to ship code that not only delivers on customer expectations and is bug-free, but also performs well. After all, poor performance is a bug in itself, and can quickly lead to a failed app.
* After this screencast, you'll be able to...
  * Start the sentence with "a this screencast" and tell them what they will doing to solve the business problem.
* Prerequisites
  * This is usually standardized with something like..
Basic knowledge or experience building applications in Swift is recommended.
* Additional Resources
  * Links to additional resources
* Tags
  * Choose from our [tags](https://thefrontier.bignerdranch.com/tags)
  * Any new tags will be added by the admin

<i>Some of the more recent screencasts have this type of description. If you're having trouble creating your description, set up time with The Frontier PM for help. </i>

### How to Structure Your Project Folder

Remember the folder we put our Google Doc Script in?

Your folder structure should look like the following example:

Google Drive >> The Frontier >> Screencasts >> iOS >> Custom Phalanges in iOS

Here's the [screencast team drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AB5mvO1W-JOUUk9PVA) again just in case.

In your folder you should have the following files:

* Outline / Script (Google Doc)
* Raw Video Files (.mov)
  * sometimes your files get broken up into a few videos when recording, just make sure to note it in the editor notes.
* Raw Audio Files (.mp4)
  * You should have 3 audio files
    * one from recording your screencast audio
    * one for your intro
    * one for your outro
* Editor Notes (Google Doc)
  * Create a new folder titled "Editor Notes"
  * Include a Google Doc with notes
  * [Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rrG0dlsLjzjy30QsAkft4Rcr9cEqjC69Bc5nWMn3P0o/edit)
* Zipped up Solution files
  * Pro tip: Some of our more popular videos have a "Start" and "Finish" solution file so the user can follow along.
* Description File
  * Example - [Minimizing Bundle Sizes in React](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qiBymXV9I_Fez2NlKAQMHRVhnuuBbH5NwuGq9gVJkQo/edit)

<strong>Example Image:</strong>  

![](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/3m1c3a162W0s2h1S3Y3p/Image%202018-11-14%20at%208.21.28%20AM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=2812380&v=066c2665)

### Submitting Your Screencast for Editing

Once your¬†screencast project folder is set, you'll submit the project folder to our editors.  

Send an email to either one of our two editors (pick one) and CC thefrontier@bignerdranch.com  

<strong>Jennifer Pradhan - jrp098@gmail.com</strong>  
PC-based (uses Premier), very quick, very professional work, friend of ours, local

<strong>Tim Ritter - tpritter@gmail.com</strong>  
Mac-based, has ScreenFlow software (but uses Premiere), freelances on the side, used to work for TreeHouse, based in Orlando, teaches film school!

<i>Note: You don‚Äôt need to create the intro or outro (title screens that give the name of your Screencast). Our editors do that.</i>

### What Happens if I have to Re-Record?  

If the editor needs you to re-record something, simply upload a new raw clip into the folder as directed. The turnaround here could be days in between.  

Add your new files to the project folder, email the editor, and CC thefrontier@bignerdranch.com  


Notes:
* Make sure to CC thefrontier@bignerdranch.com on communications with the editors. This helps us keep the project moving.
* After a few months we can archive these or get rid of these folders. But it is important that we keep a track of the original and edited version of the screencasts. We never know what or how we will need them!

## For The More Curious

### Pro Tips

#### What if I make a mistake during recording?
No worries - our editors can fix it. Just clap loudly, wait a beat, then continue. (The clap leaves a distinctive audio profile that makes it easy to find the error point.) Tell the editor so they know to look for and cut your oopsy. Bonus points if you note the recording time down for them.  

#### How to come up with an idea:  
* Scroll back in the #ios, #android, #web, #design channels.  
* Find a problem we solved. Show it.
* Create a screencast from a popular blog post
* Create a screencast that builds on an app from the books / courses.
* Search PRs from the project you‚Äôre on for inspiration.

#### Alternate recording flow (audio/video/audio sandwich):
* Get your script as close to what you want to say as possible.
* Record your audio first. No code, just read the script at a normal, conversational pace.
* Now record your screen and play the audio.
Minimize the audio player.
* Use the global play/pause button on your keyboard to start and stop the audio playback.
* Code along with your audio. If the audio is getting ahead of you, pause it until you catch up. Now you know exactly how long it takes to code the script.
* Now play that video and record a new audio track in time w/ the video.
* The new audio track and the video file should be ready to send to the editors.

#### Introducing the Problem/Solution

After your intro (‚ÄúHello, my name is‚Ä¶‚Äù), you will want to frame the problem/solution or give some introduction about a concept. That‚Äôs fine. But keep it short. Brevity is key. If you must, consider visuals to go along with your explanation.  

For instance if you‚Äôre talking about implementing Touch ID, and explaining the default passcode system, consider just showing an emulator or a webpage describing it, or the API or SDK or even the HIG on user authentication guidelines, so we can watch you thinking through and researching, instead of staring at the intro screen for 30 seconds while you talk.  Don‚Äôt worry about creating any new diagrams like a tutorial -- this is a screencast, so share your screen and your browser!  

Remember, your audience is here to see how you work and learn with you, not for you to teach a lesson with fundamentals and fancy diagrams.  

Focus on the context of the problem you‚Äôre solving.    

Introduce something, orient your viewer, describe current state, and the future state.Context matters.  

#### Don‚Äôt Take My Word for it...

Experiences from others, so you may learn from them:  

>‚ÄúOn the content creation side, it was a positive experience that proved to be much more time consuming than I initially expected. By the end, I put over 15 hours into each screencast. If I did it again, I think I could bring that down to 10 hours. The most time-consuming part for me was building the sample project. For that reason, I'd encourage any other first-timers to only choose topics from client work where the code already exists, and they've spent time mulling over the issues in their normal course of work. That was the situation I was in for the throttling screencast, and the whole process was smoother and more organic. The other two screencasts I created felt more contrived.‚Äù  - Sam L

>‚ÄúAs is already mentioned, casting on a topic you already know well helps a lot. I actually had drafts of blog posts prepared beforehand, so that gave me even more of a boost. Even if folks wrote outlines in advance that would help ‚Äòem. Having a comfort level with public speaking also helped me a lot. Folks without that will have an increased stress level, and may have to do a lot more retakes." -Josh J

>"A few tips for avoiding having to re-record:
Disable notifications, obvs!
Turn off Bluetooth so you won‚Äôt get any disconnect/reconnect popups" - Josh J

#### Third Person? First Person?
For our books (Big Nerd Ranch Guides), we use direct language/you as much as possible, e.g. ‚Äúclick the red button‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúI click the red button‚Äù or ‚Äúyou click the red button‚Äù. We only use ‚Äúwe‚Äù to refer to Big Nerd Ranch/authors, not to the collective ‚Äúme the author and you the reader‚Äù.  However, in our screencasts, we‚Äôre taking a deliberately different approach.  Course materials have the expectation the reader is following along step-by-step.  Screencasts don't.  We liken screencasts to the post-lab teaching in the classroom, when we live demo.  Thus, in screencasts, the subscriber is joining us on our journey, and working with us, so we suggest using ‚Äúwe‚Äù phrases like:
* We want to be able to do this, so let‚Äôs look into this‚Ä¶.
* We will change the x, so that y happens
* We go here.

However, this is a rough guideline, and doesn‚Äôt have to be followed. You can find examples of screencasts where we are authoritative and explain the concept, and others where we direct and say: ‚Äúyou will want to do x‚Äù. Regardless, screencasts are meant to be a bit informal.
